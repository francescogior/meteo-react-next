# meteo

*a simple meteo app powered by [Yahoo! API](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/), demonstration usage of [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Next](https://github.com/zeit/next)*

[Here is a live DEMO](https://meteo-ertawcwkso.now.sh/)

Requirements: `node@8` and `yarn@1` (`node@7` and any `yarn` should be fine).

To run it: `yarn && yarn build && yarn start` (`npm i && npm build && npm start` should be fine) and open any modern browser (like Chrome, Firefox... it should support `fetch` API) on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
